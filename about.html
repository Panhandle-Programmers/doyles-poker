    <p class="programmerName">♠️ Demarquise Jolley</p>
       <p> With 3 years in the US Army safeguarding assets worth over $1 million and managing security operations,
         I transitioned to entrepreneurship to hone leadership and logistics skills. Currently a Plant Operator
          at Dell Seton Hospital, I leverage SAP certification and technical proficiency to solve problems with discipline, 
          adaptability, and strategic thinking.</p>
    <p class="programmerName">♣️ Ryan Potts</p>
        <p>Lover of the internet, computers and all their respective workings.
            
            From an old school online media buying background to a software development future, Ryan is committed to
             doing what is necessary to see the project through to completion. 
            
             Front end, back end or full stack – Ryan is happiest when faced with a challenge.
            </p>
    <p class="programmerName">♦️ Brandon Jensen</p>
            <p>Coming from a varied background spanning retail, construction, and sales, I've honed problem-solving, teamwork, and
                 customer service skills critical in software development. With insights from retail and sales, I excel in user 
                 understanding and enhancing software experiences. From my time in the construction industry, I bring precise planning 
                 and execution to coding and project management. My aim is to specialize in full-stack development and bring innovation 
                 to a team focused on impactful software solutions.</p>
